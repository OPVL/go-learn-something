# go-learn-something
just a shitty repo full of examples from https://gobyexample.com

### running examples

includes `run.sh` that takes a module name and will execute the corresponding file
`$: ./run.sh constants`

### building examples

includes `build.sh` that takes a module name and will build the corresponding file
`$: ./build.sh constants`

outputs: > builds/constants
